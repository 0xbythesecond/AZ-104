<h1> AZ-104 </h1>

###  Notes to help me prepare for the Microsoft AZ-104


**Connect** <br />
When you're working with a local install of Azure PowerShell, you'll need to authenticate before you can execute Azure commands. The `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet prompts for your Azure credentials, then connects to your Azure subscription. It has many optional parameters, but if all you need is an interactive prompt, you don't need any parameters:

Use the `Get-AzContext` cmdlet to determine which subscription is active.

Get a list of all subscription names in your account with the Get-AzSubscription command.

You can retrieve a list of all Resource Groups in the active subscription.
`Get-AzResourceGroup`
To get a more concise view, you can send the output from the Get-AzResourceGroup to the Format-Table cmdlet using a pipe '|'.
`Get-AzResourceGroup` | `Format-Table`

You can create resource groups by using the `New-AzResourceGroup` cmdlet. You must specify a name and location. The name must be unique within your subscription. The location determines where the metadata for your resource group will be stored (which may be important to you for compliance reasons). 

New-AzResourceGroup -Name <name> -Location <location>

Create an Azure Virtual Machine
Another common task you can do with PowerShell is to create VMs.

Azure PowerShell provides the `New-AzVm` cmdlet to create a virtual machine. The cmdlet has many parameters to let it handle the large number of VM configuration settings. Most of the parameters have reasonable default values, so we only need to specify five things:

- ResourceGroupName: The resource group into which the new VM will be placed.
- Name: The name of the VM in Azure.
- Location: Geographic location where the VM will be provisioned.
- Credential: An object containing the username and password for the VM admin account. We'll use the Get-Credential cmdlet. This cmdlet will prompt for a username and password and package it into a credential object.
- Image: The operating system image to use for the VM, which is typically a Linux distribution or Windows Server.
```powershell
New-AzVm
       -ResourceGroupName <resource group name>
       -Name <machine name>
       -Credential <credentials object>
       -Location <location>
       -Image <image name>
  ```
You can supply these parameters directly to the cmdlet as shown in the previous example. Alternatively, you can use other cmdlets to configure the virtual machine, such as `Set-AzVMOperatingSystem`, `Set-AzVMSourceImage`, `Add-AzVMNetworkInterface`, and `Set-AzVMOSDisk`.

Here's an example that strings the Get-Credential cmdlet together with the `-Credential` parameter:
  | Command | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `Remove-AzVM` | Deletes an Azure VM |
  | `Start-AzVM` | 	Start a stopped VM |
  | `Stop-AzVM` | Stop a running VM |
  | `Restart-AzVM` | Restart a VM |
  | `Update-AzVM`	| Updates the configuration for a VM |
  
  You can list the VMs in your subscription using the Get-AzVM -Status command. This command also supports entering a specific VM by including the -Name property. Here, we'll assign it to a PowerShell variable:
  ```powershell
  $vm = Get-AzVM  -Name MyVM -ResourceGroupName ExerciseResources
```

The interesting thing is that now your VM is an object with which you can interact. For example, you can make changes to that object, then push changes back to Azure by using the Update-AzVM command:

```powerShell
$ResourceGroupName = "ExerciseResources"
$vm = Get-AzVM  -Name MyVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
$vm.HardwareProfile.vmSize = "Standard_DS3_v2"

Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName  -VM $vm
```
The interactive mode in PowerShell is appropriate for one-off tasks. In our example, we'll likely use the same resource group for the lifetime of the project, so creating it interactively is reasonable. Interactive mode is often quicker and easier for this task than writing a script and executing that script exactly once.

You can reach into complex objects through a dot (".") notation. For example, to see the properties in the VMSize object associated with the HardwareProfile section, run the following command:
```powershell
$vm.HardwareProfile

VmSize          VmSizeProperties
------          ----------------
Standard_D2s_v3 
```
To get information on one of the disks, run the following command:
```powershell
$vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk

OsType                  : Linux
EncryptionSettings      : 
Name                    : testvm-eus-01_disk1_3d16b00420464f0b9052cbc39e535925
Vhd                     : 
Image                   : 
Caching                 : ReadWrite
WriteAcceleratorEnabled : 
DiffDiskSettings        : 
CreateOption            : FromImage
DiskSizeGB              : 30
ManagedDisk             : Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Models.ManagedDiskP
                          arameters
DeleteOption            : Detach
```
 to get your public IP address:
 ```powershell
 Get-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName [resource group name] -Name "testvm-01"
 ```
 
 ### Delete a VM
 To try out some more commands, let's delete the VM. We'll shut it down first:

```powershell
Stop-AzVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName
```
Now, let's delete the VM by running the Remove-AzVM cmdlet:

```powershell
Remove-AzVM -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName
```

Run this command to list all the resources in your resource group:
```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName | Format-Table
```
Delete the network interface:

```PowerShell
$vm | Remove-AzNetworkInterface â€“Force
```
Delete the managed OS disks and storage account:

```PowerShell
Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -DiskName $vm.StorageProfile.OSDisk.Name | Remove-AzDisk -Force
```
Next, delete the virtual network:

```PowerShell
Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName | Remove-AzVirtualNetwork -Force
```
Delete the network security group:

```PowerShell
Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName | Remove-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Force
```
And finally, delete the public IP address:

```PowerShell
Get-AzPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName | Remove-AzPublicIpAddress -Force
```
### Variables
In the last unit, you saw that PowerShell supports variables. Use $ to declare a variable and = to assign a value. For example:
```powershell
$loc = "East US"
$iterations = 3
```
### Loops
PowerShell has several loop structures, including `For`, `Do...While`, and `For...Each`. The For loop is the best match for our needs because we'll execute a cmdlet a fixed number of times.

The following example shows the core syntax. The example runs for two iterations and prints the value of i each time. The comparison operators are written `-lt` for "less than", `-le` for "less than or equal", `-eq` for "equal", `-ne` for "not equal", etc.
```powershell 
For ($i = 1; $i -lt 3; $i++)
{
    $i
}
```

Start by capturing the input parameter in a variable. Add the following line to your script.
Prompt for a username and password for the VM's admin account and capture the result in a variable, create a loop that executes three times, and in the loop body, create a name for each VM and store it in a variable, then output it to the console. Last, create a VM using the $vmName variable:
```powershell
param([string]$resourceGroup)

$adminCredential = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the VM administrator."

For ($i = 1; $i -le 3; $i++)
{
    $vmName = "ConferenceDemo" + $i
    Write-Host "Creating VM: " $vmName
    New-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $vmName -Credential $adminCredential -Image Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal:20_04-lts:latest
}
```
# What Azure resources can be managed using the Azure CLI?
The Azure CLI lets you control nearly every aspect of every Azure resource. You can work with resource groups, storage, virtual machines, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), containers, machine learning, and so on.

Commands in the CLI are structured in groups and subgroups. Each group represents a service provided by Azure, and the subgroups divide commands for these services into logical groupings. For example, the storage group contains subgroups including account, blob, and queue.

So, how do you find the particular commands you need? One way is to use az find, the AI robot that uses the Azure documentation to tell you more about commands, the CLI, and more.

Example: find the most popular commands related to the word blob.
```
az find blob
```       
If you already know the name of the command you want, the --help argument for that command will get you more detailed information on the command, and a list of the available subcommands for a command group. So, with our storage example, here's how you can get a list of the subgroups and commands for managing blob storage:
```
az storage blob --help
```       
### Connect
Since you're working with a local install of the Azure CLI, you'll need to authenticate before you can execute Azure commands by using the Azure CLI login command.

``` 
 az login
```

After a successful sign-in, you'll be connected to your Azure subscription.

### Create
You'll often need to create a new resource group before you create a new Azure service, so we'll use resource groups as an example to show how to create Azure resources from the CLI.

The Azure CLI group create command creates a resource group. You must specify a name and location. The name must be unique within your subscription. The location determines where the metadata for your resource group will be stored. You use strings like "West US", "North Europe", or "West India" to specify the location; alternatively, you can use single-word equivalents, such as westus, northeurope, or westindia. The core syntax is:

```
az group create --name <name> --location <location>
```       
### Verify
For many Azure resources, the Azure CLI provides a list subcommand to view resource details. For example, the Azure CLI group list command lists your Azure resource groups. This is useful to verify whether the resource group was successfully created:

```
az group list
```       
To get a more concise view, you can format the output as a simple table:

```
az group list --output table       
```

 **Single sign-on (SSO) access**
 - Azure AD provides secure single sign-on (SSO) to web apps on the cloud and to on-premises apps. Users can sign in with the same set of credentials to access all their apps.
 
  **Ubiquitous device support**
  
  - Azure AD works with iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows devices, and offers a common experience across the devices. Users can launch apps from a personalized web-based access panel, mobile app, Microsoft 365, or custom company portals by using their existing work credentials.
  
  **Secure remote access**	
  
  - Azure AD enables secure remote access for on-premises web apps. Secure access can include multifactor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and group-based access management. Users can access on-premises web apps from everywhere, including from the same portal.
  
  **Cloud extensibility**	
  
  - Azure AD can extend to the cloud to help you manage a consistent set of users, groups, passwords, and devices across environments.
  
  **Sensitive data protection**	
  
  - Azure AD offers unique identity protection capabilities to secure your sensitive data and apps. Admins can monitor for suspicious sign-in activity and potential vulnerabilities in a consolidated view of users and resources in the directory.
  
  **Self-service support**
  
  - Azure AD lets you delegate tasks to company employees that might otherwise be completed by admins with higher access privileges. Providing self-service app access and password management through verification steps can reduce helpdesk calls and enhance security.

# Things to consider when using Azure AD features
Azure AD offers many features and benefits. Consider which features can be used to best support your corporate scenarios.

Consider enabling single sign-on access. Enable SSO access for your users to connect to the cloud or use on-premises apps. Azure AD SSO supports Microsoft 365 and thousands of SaaS apps, such as Salesforce, Workday, DocuSign, ServiceNow, and Box.

Consider UX and device support. Build a consistent user experience that works for all devices and directory access points. You can design custom company portals and personalized web-based access for your employees that lets them connect with their existing work credentials.

Consider benefits of secure remote access. Protect your on-premises web apps by implementing secure remote access with MFA and access policies.

Consider advantages of cloud extensibility. Connect Active Directory and other on-premises directories in the cloud to Azure AD in just a few steps. You can make it easier for your admins to manage the same users, groups, passwords, and devices across all supported environments.

Consider advanced protection for sensitive data. Enhance the security of your sensitive data and apps by using the built-in protection features of Azure AD. Your admins can utilize advanced security reports, notifications, remediation recommendations, and risk-based policies.

Consider reduced costs, self-service options. Take advantage of the Azure AD self-service features to help reduce costs for your organization. Delegate certain tasks like resetting passwords, or creating and managing groups to your non-admin users.

  | Azure AD concept | Description |
  | ---------------- | ----------- |
  | Identity	| An identity is an object that can be authenticated. The identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities can also be applications or other servers that require authentication by using secret keys or certificates. Azure AD is the underlying product that provides the identity service.
  | Account  | An account is an identity that has data associated with it. To have an account, you must first have a valid identity. You can't have an account without an identity.
  | Azure AD account	| An Azure AD account is an identity that's created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and are accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. The Azure AD account is also called a work or school account.
  | Azure tenant (directory) | An Azure tenant is a single dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD. Each tenant (also called a directory) represents a single organization. When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, a new tenant is automatically created. Because each tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD, you can create multiple tenants or instances.
  | Azure subscription | An Azure subscription is used to pay for Azure cloud services. A subscription is linked to a credit card. Each subscription is joined to a single tenant. You can have multiple subscriptions. |
